## Introduction
Current techological advances has made it possible to profile individal cells by allowing researchers to prepare sequenceing libraries from small amont of samples. Having data at single-cell resoultion is required to address questions that can not be addressed with high-throughput sequencing data. 


## Common challenges
Data generation- One of the major difficulty in single-cell analysis is the initial isolation and culture of a single cell.
Another challenge lies in processing power as you are analyzing individual cell in a population. This requires analysis from all aspects to understand the complexity of a cell population.

Analysis- Single-cell data generally has low library sizes, high noise level and a large fraction of gene drop out events, i.e., failure to observe some genes although they are indeed expressed in a given cell, which makes it diffcilut to analyze compared to HTS RNA-seq data.
