## Introduction



## Common challenges
One of the major difficulty in single-cell analysis is the initial isolation and culture of a single cell.
Another challenge lies in processing power as you are analyzing individual cell in a population. This requires analysis from all aspects to understand the complexity of a cell population.




## Advantages and applications of single-cell analysis
